Hi there Tailwind Labs Team,

I’m Sherif Saleh, reaching out from Zurich with a keen interest in the Design Engineer role you’ve posted. My background spans over 16 years in UX/UI design, with a notable stint at Neue Zürcher Zeitung—regarded as Switzerland's answer to the New York Times.

My entrepreneurial side led me to create Craftingemails.com, where we harness Tailwind CSS to revolutionize email design, making it more user-friendly. This venture, in collaboration with Cosmin from the Maizzle framework, has given me a deep appreciation for the flexibility and power of Tailwind CSS, which I’m eager to bring to your team.

My approach to design is deeply rooted in the belief that good design is functional and accessible, a philosophy that aligns with the ethos at Tailwind Labs. I’m particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on projects that blend design with cutting-edge technology, and I’m excited about the prospect of contributing to Tailwind CSS’s evolution.


I actively engage with the technologies at the forefront of web development. Tailwind CSS, React, and Next.js are integral to my skill set, enabling me to develop dynamic, responsive designs that elevate the user experience. My proficiency with these tools aligns closely with the tech stack at Tailwind Labs, fueling my enthusiasm for the collaborative and innovative opportunities that lie ahead with your team.


I value the importance of community and knowledge sharing, something I see mirrored in Tailwind Labs’ culture. I’m looking forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience with design systems, user engagement, and my passion for creating intuitive, elegant solutions can contribute to your projects.

I appreciate your consideration and would be thrilled to further discuss how I can contribute to Tailwind Labs. Looking forward to the possibility of joining your team.

Warm regards,

Sherif Saleh
