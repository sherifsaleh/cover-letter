Hi there Tailwind Labs Team,

I’m Sherif Saleh, reaching out from surprisingly sunny Zurich with a keen interest in the Design Engineer role you’ve posted. With over 16 years of experience in UX/UI design, including a significant tenure at Neue Zürcher Zeitung—a publication often compared to the New York Times—I bring a wealth of knowledge and insight. 

My entrepreneurial journey led to the founding of craftingemails.com, where, alongside Cosmin from the Maizzle framework, we've revolutionized email design using Tailwind CSS to enhance user-friendliness. This collaboration has deepened my appreciation for the versatility and robustness of Tailwind CSS, skills  I'm excited to contribute to your team.

My approach to design is deeply rooted in the belief that good design is functional and accessible, a philosophy that aligns with the ethos at Tailwind Labs. I’m particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on projects that blend design with cutting-edge technology, and I’m excited about the prospect of contributing to Tailwind CSS’s evolution.


I actively engage with the technologies at the forefront of web development. Tailwind CSS, React, and Next.js are integral to my skill set, enabling me to develop dynamic, responsive designs that elevate the user experience. My proficiency with these tools aligns closely with the tech stack at Tailwind Labs, fueling my enthusiasm for the collaborative and innovative opportunities that lie ahead with your team.


I value the importance of community and knowledge sharing, something I see mirrored in Tailwind Labs’ culture. I’m looking forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience with design systems, user engagement, and my passion for creating intuitive, elegant solutions can contribute to your projects.

I appreciate your consideration and would be thrilled to further discuss how I can contribute to Tailwind Labs. Looking forward to the possibility of joining your team.

Warm regards,

Sherif Saleh
